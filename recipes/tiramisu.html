<p> 
    This is also my Nonna Burchesi's recipe. <strong>She was the greatest Nonna</strong>, and someone broke into our house and stole the family recipes. Including Nonna's beloved tiramisu. <b><em>Mal'occhio be upon them.</em></b>
</p>
<h3>Ingredients List</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
	<li>8-ounce container marscapone cheese, room temperature</li>
	<li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons coffee flavored liquer, optional (Kahlua or DaVinci brands)</li>
    <li>1 package Lady Fingers, Savoiardi brand can be found in the cookie aisle at your local grocery store, or online</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder for dusting the top</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan.</li>
    <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>
    <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><strong>Acohol:</strong>  Tiramisu can be made with or without alcohol. This recipe calls for coffee flavored liqueur because I like that it enhances the coffee flavor, but other options are marsala wine or brandy. </p> 
 <p><strong>Make Ahead Instructions:</strong>  Tiramisu is even better when made in advance, allowing the flavors to blend! It will keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.</p>
<p><strong>Acohol:</strong>  Make completely, but don't dust with cocoa powder. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and then tinfoil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and dust with cocoa powder a few hours before serving.</p>
